# LodeRunner

Class project for Game Programming (GPro) at Olin College of Engineering, Allison Patterson & Jacob Kingery.

## Basic Gameplay

To launch, run `python loderunner.py`.

### Moving:
Navigate your sprite ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/t_android.gif "this is you") with the arrow keys ( up <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, down <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, left <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and right <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> ).

Move horizontally ( <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> ) on brick ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/brick.gif "brick") or rope ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/rope.gif "rope") tiles.

Move vertically ( <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> and <kbd>&darr;</kbd> ) on ladder ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/ladder.gif "climb me") tiles, or by falling off of things.
### Digging:
Dig through the brick floor to your left with <kbd>z</kbd> or to your right with <kbd>x</kbd>.

Use digging to access closed areas, drop down to lower tiles or to watch the baddies ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/t_red.gif "mean dude") fall.

The hole will close after a delay, so tread lightly.
### Winning:

Collect all the gold ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/gold.gif "ooh, shiny") and then escape via the ladder ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/ladder.gif "climb me") in the top right corner.

Don't die in a hole (literally) and don't let the baddies ![alt text](https://github.com/allisongpatterson/LodeRunner/blob/master/sprites/t_red.gif "mean dude") catch you.

Enjoy!
